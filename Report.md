The final report should be in markdown format, in the style of a conference paper submission. In particular, it should contain:

# Introduction: lsr (~250 words)
An explanation of the problem and the motivation for solving it.

Mental health is influenced by a complex interplay of individual behaviors, such as sleep patterns and stress levels, and broader socioeconomic factors, including GDP and national happiness scores. Despite the recognition of this multifaceted relationship, existing research and tools often analyze these dimensions in isolation, resulting in a fragmented understanding of their combined impact on mental well-being. This project addresses this critical gap by integrating individual-level mental health data with national-level socioeconomic indicators, creating a unified framework for exploration and analysis. Academically, the project contributes to interdisciplinary research by developing a robust data integration pipeline, addressing challenges in multi-source data harmonization, and advancing methodologies to investigate correlations between lifestyle factors and socioeconomic contexts. By leveraging advanced visualization and predictive analytics, this work provides novel insights into the determinants of mental health, with implications for both academic research and practical applications.

Our contributions are summarized as follows:
Data Integration: Implements rigorous preprocessing to harmonize individual and national-level datasets, ensuring consistency and methodological robustness.
Visual Analytics: Employs diverse visualization techniques, including correlation heatmaps, bar charts, and geographic maps, to uncover relationships in the data.
Predictive Modeling: Develops machine learning models to assess mental health risks, offering interpretable and actionable insights.
Interactive Platform: Provides a Streamlit application that translates academic findings into an accessible tool for self-assessment and awareness.
This project advances the academic discourse on mental health by addressing methodological gaps and integrating interdisciplinary approaches while offering practical tools to foster better mental health outcomes.

## Data Processing:
We began by loading the yearly World Happiness Report data from 2016 through 2021, as well as a separate mental health dataset.

For each year of happiness data, we have carefully renamed the columns to ensure that "Country," "Happiness score," "GDP," "Healthy life expectancy," and "Corruption.", among other key variables, have consistent naming conventions. We also normalized the values of 'GDP', 'Healthy life expectancy', and 'Corruption' of each year using MinMaxScaler to ensure that they remained comparable across years and scales.

After processing each year's dataset, we merged them into a single comprehensive dataset and selected the countries that were present in the mental health dataset. We then converted "United States" to "USA" and "United Kingdom" to "UK" to match the country names in the mental health dataset. Since the mental health dataset does not specify the year in which data were collected, we calculated the average of the "Happiness Score", "GDP", "Corruption", and "Healthy Life Expectancy" for each country for all years.

Additionally, we processed the mental health dataset. We removed "Severity" because we wanted to train a binary classifier and therefore could not predict the severity of mental health issue. We also renamed "Mental_Health_Condition" to "Mental_Health_Issue" to make the analysis and data presentation more intuitive. Finally, we merged this mental health dataset with the comprehensive dataset about countries to form a dataset linking mental health issues to various socioeconomic indicators.


## Analysis: kyb (+lsr)
We used a variety of visualizations to analyze the data, such as a heat map, a line plot, a box plot, and bar plots. Using these visualizations, we analyzed various aspects of this dataset in detail to find out what factors are associated with the presence of mental health issue.

Specifically, we used a heat map to check the correlation between the variables, especially whether “Mental_Health_Issue” has a high correlation with other variables. Next, we analyzed the factors affecting mental health in terms of socioeconomic aspects. We used a bar plot, a line plot, and a box plot to see how the quantitative variables varied across countries. Finally, we focused on individuals, using bar charts to see if there were patterns in the personal daily lives of people with and without mental health issue.

What has the audience learned from your work? What new insights or practices has your system enabled? Informal observations of use that help evaluate your system are encouraged.


# Future Work: lsr (~150 words)
A description of how your application could be extended or refined. 

Model Improvement and Extension
While the current implementation uses predictive models to evaluate mental health risks, future work could explore more sophisticated machine learning models, such as ensemble methods or neural networks, to enhance predictive accuracy. Additionally, incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques could help make predictions more interpretable, providing users with actionable insights about the factors most influencing their mental health scores.
Dynamic Data Updates
The app currently operates on pre-processed datasets. Future iterations could include real-time data integration, allowing the system to incorporate new records or updates from live sources like public health surveys or global indices. This would make the tool more adaptive and reflective of current trends.
Expanded Dataset Integration
Additional datasets, such as those capturing cultural, environmental, or historical trends, could be integrated to further contextualize mental health assessments. For instance, data on climate, urbanization, or internet access could provide new angles for analysis and predictive modeling.


Your final paper should be formatted using markdown.   Your report should be approximately ~2000 words (or about 4 pages if you were to print it).
